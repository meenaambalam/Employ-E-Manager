<div id="install"/>
        
## Installation Instruction:
```
Node, Inquirer, console.table and MySQL. The application is dependent on "Node" CLI. Dependent on "Inquirer" for prompting users with option to add, update and delete department, role and employee information. The data is stored in MySQL database, so it required a installation of "mysql". The "console.table" installation is necessary to view the results in the better formatted display, compared to console.log of the database resultSet.
```
        
<div id="usage"/>
        
## Usage:
```
The application can be started by "node index". Options to add, delete, update roles/departments/employees will be presented. As appropriate responses are provided, the data will be added/updated/deleted to/from the database. Other options to view the data also is presented and the resultSet will be displayed. Additional option to go back to MainMenu or AddMenu or ViewMenu are presented, so the user can do all their operation without having to kick off the "node index" for each and every operation.
